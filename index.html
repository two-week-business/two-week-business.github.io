										They do not plan on continuing the business in the the near term, but will resume operations on a larger scale as a senior project in two years.

Their early pivots cost them both time and money - they spent most of their budget on wasted smoothie supplies. However, they did eventually establish a lucrative business model and managed to get themselves out of the red.

										Cabler had an early disadvantage - both teammates joined the class a day late. However, they made up for lost time by immediately beginning production of their 3D printed cable clips. Despite this, due to issues with the 3D printers, the team was not able to complete production until the last day of class, leaving no time to sell. However, both teammates plan on trying again in next intersession's Two Week Business, this time as seasoned veterans.
